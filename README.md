# Introduction

IoT devices are growing exponentially in numbers, which necessitates the need to scale up their data processing architectures in a secure and low-latency manner. Fog computing brings the Cloud services even closer to the edge providing local decisions and this is very much needed in military or surveillance setting. With the traditional cloud systems already experiencing problems related to latency and bandwidth, fog computing presents great potential in helping fill this gap between low-level edge devices and the more centralized data centres.

The targeted IEEE paper proposes a Cache Decision System (CDS) to utilize the capabilities of the fog nodes on the basis of differentiating between secure (HTTPS) and insecure (HTTP) IoT traffic. The system delivers higher energy efficiency and minimal latency through emphasis on secure data and maximum optimization of the location of application modules.

Its project aims to replicate the original architecture using iFogSim and using Azure IoT Hub services to simulate the traffic and the development of a real-time Streamlit-based dashboard through visual analytics. Through the simulation of the flow of tuples, the number of transactions made using energy and the usage of the network, the project may provide the data on the feasibility of such a system execution in real smart environments.
